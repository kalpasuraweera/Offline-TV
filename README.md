# Offline-TV

Offline-TV is a Python GUI application designed to help control excessive TV series consumption by encrypting files within a specified folder. The application takes a folder path as input and encrypts all files within it, saving them with dates from the current day onwards. By utilizing a decryption feature accessible via a 'Decrypt' button on the interface, users can only access and watch files with names corresponding to the current day.

This project aims to curb binge-watching habits by limiting access to a single episode per day, offering a structured approach to consuming content and promoting a healthier viewing routine.

## How it Works

1.  **Encryption:** Input a folder path, and the application encrypts all files within it, saving them with dates starting from the current day.
    
2.  **Decryption:** On pressing the 'Decrypt' button, the program decrypts the files that match the current day's date, allowing access to only one episode per day.
    

This project serves as a tool to break addictive TV series consumption patterns and encourages a more balanced viewing experience.
